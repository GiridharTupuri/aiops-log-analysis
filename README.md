# AIOps for Log Analysis using Python

This project demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps)** can be applied to log analysis using Python and machine learning, specifically for **anomaly detection** in system logs.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual patterns or spikes in log behavior.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Trace anomalies back to potential sources.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Forecast potential failures based on historical logs.
- **Alert Prioritization:** Automatically categorize alerts based on severity.
- **Automated Remediation (Future Scope):** Trigger actions when anomalies are detected.

## Why AIOps for Log Analysis?

Modern microservices environments generate **millions of logs daily**. Traditional approaches like `grep`, ELK Stack, or Loki are useful—but often **reactive**.

AIOps brings a **proactive** approach:
- Detect unknown issues early.
- Handle massive volumes of data.
- Discover hidden patterns that traditional tools miss.

## 🧠 ML Algorithm Used: Isolation Forest

We use [`IsolationForest`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html), an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm**, excellent for anomaly detection in high-volume data.

Advantages:
- No labeled data required.
- High efficiency with large-scale data.
- Better accuracy when `contamination` (expected % anomalies) is set low.
